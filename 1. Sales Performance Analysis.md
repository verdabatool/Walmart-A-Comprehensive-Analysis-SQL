## 1. SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
**1i. What is the monthly sales trend for each product line?**
```
SELECT
    product_line,
    month_name,
    month_number,
    ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS total_sales,
    ROUND(SUM(Total) / SUM(SUM(Total)) OVER (PARTITION BY month_name) * 100, 2) AS sales_percent_of_total
