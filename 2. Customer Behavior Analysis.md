## 2. CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
**2i. What is the average transaction value for each customer type (Member vs. Normal)?**
``` sql
SELECT 
	customer_type,
    ROUND(AVG(total),2) AS average_transaction
FROM 
	walmartsalesdata
GROUP BY 
	customer_type;
```
**Output:**
| customer_type | average_transaction |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Member        | 327.79              |
| Normal        | 318.12              |


**2ii. How does the gender of customers impact the types of products purchased and the average spend?**
``` sql
SELECT
    gender,
    product_line,
    COUNT(*) AS total_purchases,
    ROUND(AVG(total), 2) AS average_spending
FROM
    walmartsalesdata
GROUP BY
    gender, 
    product_line
ORDER BY
    gender, 
    product_line,
    total_purchases DESC;
```
**Output:**
| gender | product_line           | total_purchases | average_spending |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Female | Electronic accessories | 84              | 322.64           |
| Female | Fashion accessories    | 96              | 317.06           |

| Male   | Sports and travel      | 78              | 340.36           |


**2iii. Identify the top 5% of customers by sales volume and analyze their purchasing patterns.**
```sql
WITH sales AS (
	SELECT 
		invoiceID,
		ROUND(SUM(total),2) AS total_sales
	FROM 
		walmartsalesdata
	GROUP BY 
		invoiceID
	ORDER BY 
		InvoiceID ASC
        ),
dist_cte AS (
	SELECT 
		*,
        ROUND(CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY total_sales DESC) * 100, 2)  AS top_five_percent
	FROM 
		sales
        )
	SELECT 
		invoiceID,
        total_sales AS `top_5%_sales_volume`
	FROM 
		dist_cte
	WHERE top_five_percent <= 5.0;
```
**Output:**

| invoiceID  | top_5%_sales_volume |
|------------|---------------------|
| 860-79-0874| 1042.65             |
| 687-47-8271| 1039.29             |
| 283-26-5248| 1034.46             |
| 751-41-9720| 1023.75             |
| 303-96-2227| 1022.49             |
| 744-16-7898| 1022.38             |
| 271-88-8734| 1020.7              |
| 234-65-2137| 1003.59             |
| 554-42-2417| 1002.12             |

**2iv. Analyze the correlation between customer ratings and their purchasing volume.**
``` sql
SELECT 
	rating,
    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM 
	walmartsalesdata
GROUP BY 
	rating
ORDER BY 
	rating ASC;
```
**Output:** 

| rating | total_sales |
