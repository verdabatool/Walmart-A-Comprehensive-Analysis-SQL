## 3. PRODUCT LINE INSIGHTS
**3i. Calculate the profitability (gross income) for each product line and rank them.**
``` sql
WITH gross AS (
	SELECT 
		product_line,
		ROUND(SUM(gross_income)) AS total_gross_income
	FROM
		walmartsalesdata
	GROUP BY
		product_line
	ORDER BY 
		total_gross_income DESC
)
SELECT 
	*
FROM
	(SELECT 
		*,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_gross_income DESC) AS ranked
	FROM 
		gross) x
ORDER BY 
	total_gross_income DESC, ranked ASC;
```
**Output:**

| product_line           | total_gross_income | ranked |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------|
| Food and beverages     | 2674               | 1      |
| Sports and travel      | 2625               | 2      |
| Electronic accessories | 2588               | 3      |
| Fashion accessories    | 2586               | 4      |
| Home and lifestyle     | 2565               | 5      |
| Health and beauty      | 2343               | 6      |


**3ii. What is the average rating for each product line, and how does it correlate with sales volume?**
``` sql
SELECT 
	product_line,
    ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS average_rating,
    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM
	walmartsalesdata
GROUP BY 
	product_line
ORDER BY 
	average_rating DESC,
    total_sales DESC;
```

| product_line           | average_rating | total_sales |
|------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Food and beverages     | 7.11           | 56144.84    |
| Fashion accessories    | 7.03           | 54305.9     |

| Home and lifestyle     | 6.84           | 53861.91    |


**3iii. Identify the product lines with the highest and lowest variability in sales across different branches.**
``` sql
SELECT 
	branch,
    product_line,
    ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM
	walmartsalesdata
GROUP BY 
	branch,
    product_line
ORDER BY
	branch ASC,
    total_sales DESC;
```
**Output:**

| branch | product_line           | total_sales |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|
| A      | Home and lifestyle     | 22417.2     |
| A      | Sports and travel      | 19327.2     |
| A      | Electronic accessories | 18317.11    |

| C      | Health and beauty      | 16615.33    |
| C      | Sports and travel      | 15761.93    |
| C      | Home and lifestyle     | 13895.55    |

**3iv. Examine the price sensitivity of different product lines.**
``` sql
SELECT 
	product_line,
    ROUND(AVG(total), 2) AS average_price,
    ROUND(AVG(Quantity), 2) AS average_units_sold,
    ROUND(AVG(Total / quantity), 2) AS price_elasticity
FROM
	walmartsalesdata
GROUP BY 
	product_line
ORDER BY 
	average_price DESC,
    average_units_sold ;
```

**Output:**
| product_line           | average_price | average_units_sold | price_elasticity |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Home and lifestyle     | 336.64        | 5.69               | 58.08            |

| Fashion accessories    | 305.09        | 5.07               | 60.01            |


**3v. Forecast next month's demand for each product line based on the current trend. Identify which product lines have potential to have higher demands**
``` sql
WITH monthly_growth AS (
    SELECT 
        branch,
        product_line,
        month_name,
        AVG(quantity) AS average_quantity_sold,
        AVG(Quantity) / LAG(AVG(quantity), 1, AVG(quantity)) OVER (PARTITION BY branch, product_line ORDER BY month_number) AS monthly_growth_rate
    FROM walmartsalesdata
    GROUP BY product_line, branch, month_name, month_number
),
forecast AS (
	SELECT 
		branch,
		product_line,
		month_name,
		average_quantity_sold,
		ROUND(average_quantity_sold * monthly_growth_rate, 2) AS forecasted_demand
	FROM monthly_growth
    )
SELECT *
FROM forecast
WHERE forecasted_demand > average_quantity_sold;
```
**Output:**
| branch | product_line           | month_name | average_quantity_sold | forecasted_demand |
